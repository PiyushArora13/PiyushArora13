## Piyush Arora

B.Tech undergraduate in Electronics and Computer Engineering (VIT Chennai) with strong hands-on experience in embedded systems, electronics design, and applied hardware development. My work focuses on building reliable hardware–software systems, spanning circuit design, low-level firmware, PCB design, and early-stage ML pipeline planning for embedded and IoT applications.

I am particularly interested in embedded systems internals, VLSI fundamentals, and system-level engineering challenges where hardware constraints directly influence software, data pipelines, and on-device intelligence.

## Selected Projects

### 6-DOF Robotic Arm with Sensor Architecture for Predictive Maintenance
Designed and implemented a 6-DOF robotic arm instrumented with vibration, temperature, and current sensors. Developed the mechanical, electrical, and firmware architecture, and designed a cloud-ready ML pipeline for predictive maintenance. Mechanical motion and control were validated; multi-sensor data acquisition and ML training were identified as integration bottlenecks and documented for future work.

### Differential Drive Robot with Encoder and IMU
Developed an embedded robotic platform with motor control, encoder and IMU integration, and signal conditioning. Focused on system integration, firmware development, and validation using real sensor data, supported by Python-based analysis.

### IoT-Based Smart Waste Management System
Developed a smart waste management system using ESP32-CAM and TinyML (Edge Impulse) for waste classification, combined with ESP8266-based sensing for trash level monitoring and cloud alerts. Emphasized practical IoT system design, sensor integration, and embedded AI deployment.

### Inline Hardware Debugger (USB-C)
Designed a non-intrusive inline diagnostic PCB for master–slave embedded systems, enabling real-time electrical monitoring without affecting normal system behavior.
